    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I am Ian Maher, I am a Video Game Designer/Programer and I love developing games. I am currently atending Sno-Isle Tech Skills Center for my second year in the video game design program.
        <br>I am very creative, I love working in teams, and I am great at comunicating. I have also worked in teams to create big game projects in state wide game jams.</br>So far I have created three huge game projects, and a bunch of other smaller game projects as well.
        I am very perficient with the two coding languges I know <br> - and use, they are C# and HTML. I am also very perficient with other programs I use such as Unity, Blender/3d modeling, Sourcetree, and Github. </br>
